            <h2>About Amelia Earhart</h2>
            <p>
                Amelia Mary Earhart (1897â€“1937) was an American aviation pioneer and author. She was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, setting many records and inspiring generations of female pilots. 
                Earhart was also a key figure in the formation of The Ninety-Nines, an organization for female pilots.

                In 1937, during an attempt to fly around the world, she and her navigator, Fred Noonan, disappeared over the Pacific Ocean. Despite extensive search efforts, they were never found, making her story one of the greatest mysteries in aviation history.
